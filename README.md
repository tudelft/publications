# MAVLab Publication List
This repo is meant to keep a history of all publications to do with the Micro Air Vehicle Laboratory at the Delft University of Technology. 

## Contributing
To add a new publication, you can simply add the bibitem to the mavlab.bib, either by editing the page directly using the github editor (if you have write access to the repo) or by making a pull request with your changes. The Continuous Integration tool will test your changes to ensure that the bib file still works.
