	abstract  = {Flapping wing micro aerial vehicles (FWMAVs) are known for their flight agility and maneuverability. However, their in-gust flight performance and stability is still inferior to their biological counterparts. To this end, a simplified in-gust dynamic model, which could capture the main gust effects on FWMAVs, has been identified with real in-gust flights' data of a FWMAV, the Flapper Drone. Based on this model, an adaptive position and velocity controller was proposed with gain scheduling and implemented for in-gust flights under gust speeds up to 2.4 m/s. With this airflow-sensing based adaptive controller, the in-gust hovering stability of the Flapper Drone has been improved when the gust's intensity and frequency changes, comparing with the original fixed-gain cascaded PID controller case.},

	abstract  = {Flow sensing exists widely in nature to help animals perform certain tasks. It has also been widely adopted in engineering applications with different types of sensing instrumentation. In particular, in the field of aerospace engineering, airflow sensing is crucial to vehicle state evaluation and flight control. This project surveys the key mechanisms from biological features in nature that enable flow sensing and expands towards the application motivation to identify a suitable airflow sensor that can be equipped to a flapping wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV) for onboard airflow sensing. <br/><br/>The selection of sensors is first narrowed down to three major types of airflow sensors from the state of art that have the most potential to be integrated onboard a flapping wing MAV, considering the sensor performance need, size, weight and power (SWaP) restrictions. Two thermal-based commercially available low-cost airflow sensors RevP and RevC from Modern Device have been selected after the trade-off analysis. <br/><br/>A full workflow of calibrating and evaluating the two airflow sensors' directional sensitivity has been carried out through two wind tunnel campaigns. Their performance under grid-generated turbulence is compared with a constant temperature hot-wire anemometer. This series of tests leads to the conclusion that the RevP airflow sensor has better performance and is therefore chosen to be placed onboard a flapping wing MAV Delfly Nimble. <br/><br/>Both mounted tests and tethered hovering tests with the Delfly Nimble are performed to further examine the airflow sensor RevP's measurement performance under different influence factors such as MAV throttle levels, MAV body pitch angles and freestream speeds. In the end, it is concluded that as a proof of concept, the RevP sensor is capable of performing effective measurements for low flow speeds less than 4 m/s, within the pitching angle range of -30 to 30 degrees. Although this is the first achieved tethered hover flight with onboard airflow sensing for a flapping wing MAV, its limited payload and onboard power supply demands an even smaller and less power consuming design of airflow sensors to enable further applications such as autonomous reactive control under wind disturbances.},

	abstract  = {The continuous improvement and miniaturisation of elements in drones have been essential for making flapping-wing drones a reality. This thesis presents an integral approach for accurate indoor position control and estimation on flapping-wing drones. The approach considers three main aspects to enhance transient response of the drone. The first one is an experimental velocity/attitude flapping-wing model for drag compensation, obtained through system identification techniques. The second one is a voltage-dependent variable thrust model for enhancing height control. Thirdly, a characterisation of ground effects to determine the height for stable hovering. For the state estimation, an extended Kalman filter fuses UWB position measurements with IMU data. Due to the well-known multi-path effects of UWB, the Kalman filter includes an adaptive noise parameter based on height. The novel control strategy was validated with real flight tests, where position control improved by a factor of 1.5, reaching a mean absolute error of 10cm in positions in x and y, and 4.9cm for position in z.},

	abstract  = {Flapping-Wing Air Vehicles (FWAV) are autonomously flying vehicles that use their flapping wings to simultaneously stay aloft and enable controllable flight. FWAVs that are capable of controllable flight are reported in literature, though a theoretical background of the aerodynamic performance of different attitude control mechanisms is absent in literature and the robustness of attitude control mechanisms with respect to body motions is oftentimes omitted. The aim of this thesis is to develop a theoretical framework for the aerodynamic response of flapping wings that includes variation of attitude control parameters and motion of the vehicle body. This framework can be used to assist in research into new attitude control mechanisms for FWAVs that are not yet capable of attitude control, such as the compliant Atalanta FWAV. Analytical aerodynamic and kinematic descriptions are combined to analyze the aerodynamic performance of two suggested attitude control mechanisms: stroke amplitude variations and control of the angle of attack by means of pitching stiffness variations. It is shown in this research that both mechanisms have a significant influence on the lift production of a flapping wing, though this influence changes significantly when body motions are introduced. It is found that variations of the stroke amplitude provide the most predictable variations in lift for all cases of body motion that were considered, provided that the wing’s pitching hinge stiffness is high enough to ensure stable flapping kinematics under the influence of body motion.},

	abstract  = {Flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAV's) are a subcategory of unmanned aerial vehicle which use flapping wings for thrust generation. The high agility and maneuverability of FWMAV's are very favorable attributes, making them more applicable in cluttered spaces. A tailless FWMAV called the Delfly Nimble has been developed at the Delft University of Technology. Due to the inherent instability of the tailless design an active controller is required to ensure safe and stable flight of the drone. In previous research, models have been developed for the longitudinal dynamics of the Delfly Nimble. In this paper, a grey-box state-space model of the lateral body dynamics in hover conditions is identified using system identification techniques. The parameters which needed to be estimated were stability and control derivatives, and they were obtained with a least-squares approach. Free-flight experiments were performed to generate the identification and validation data. A doublet train was used in the identification experiments, with the gains of the controller adjusted in such a way that maximum excitation was acquired. The identified model has been validated with various maneuvers. These included doublets, 112-maneuvers, maneuvers using coupled inputs, and maneuvers with sideways flight. The resulting model is able to predict the state derivatives of most maneuver accurately, reaching accuracies of over 90% for maneuvers close to hover. Moreover, in closed-loop configuration it is able to simulate the state response accurately, with accuracies of over 85% for maneuvers close to hover, and remains stable, making it applicable for controller design and stability analysis. Finally, based on the model the inherent instability of the lateral body dynamics was also confirmed, for there are eigenvalues with positive real parts.},

	abstract  = {This study investigates the wing deformation of the flapping-wing micro air vehicle (MAV) DelFly II in various flight configurations. Experiments were carried out with the MAV tethered in a windtunnel test section. To determine the best suited measurement approach, a trade-off study was carried out which showed that a point tracking approach with background illumination is most suitable. The therefore used high-speed camera pair and illumination were mounted on the same rotating frame with the DelFly, which allowed adequate viewing axes of the wings at for all pitch angles. Processing was done a purpose-build algorithm, allowing 136 points per wing to be measured simultaneously with an average lost point ratio of 3.4 % and an estimated accuracy of 0.25 mm. Results of hovering flight show some previously unnoticed behaviors. First, it was noted that the upper and lower wing on each side do not deform purely symmetric but show some considerable asymmetric behavior like heave and camber production. Furthermore, the upper wing shows a torsional wave and recoil behavior at faster flapping frequencies, which was shown to be beneficial in insect flight. Lastly, it was found that an air-buffer remains present between the wing surfaces at all times of the clap-and-peel motion (apart from the root trailing edge). This air-buffer increases once freestream velocity is added, which is investigated during the climbing flight study. Here, the reduced angle of attack of the wing is assumed to reduce the wing loading at faster climb, resulting in lower deformations outside the clap-and-peel motion. The isolated effect of a body pitch angle is also studied. Here, the asymmetrical freestream direction results in larger asymmetries such as wing alignment with the freestream direction and reduced camber and even camber reversal during the upstroke. In forward flight the pitch angle is changed simultaneously with the flapping frequency and freestream velocity. Due to the non-linear properties the wing deforms not directly as a superposition of the individual effects. Deviations are mostly present in increased asymmetry in incidence angle, while the camber behaves more linear and the clap-and-peel motion also remains relatively unchanged. The torsional wave and recoil are here however reduced. Descending flight was also tested. Velocities below 1m/s result in relatively minor deformation changes, while faster descent leads to large flapping frequency fluctuations, making interpretation of the results impossible.},

	abstract  = {Tailless flapping wing micro aerial vehicles (FMWAV) are known for their light weight and agility. However, given the fact that these FWMAVs have been recently developed, their flight dynamics have not yet been fully explained. In this paper we will develop local time-averaged longitudinal grey-box models based on closed-loop system identification techniques, where free-flight experimental data, obtained from the DelFly Nimble, is used to estimate and validate the local grey-box models. With these models we can take the first steps towards fully understanding the flight dynamics of tailless FWMAVs. The consequence of the tailless configuration is inherent instability and therefore tailless FWMAVs are generally more complex, compared to its tailed counterpart, and require a active feedback control system. The active feedback control system introduces additional challenges to the system identification process since it follows that feedback control works against the objectives of system identification. Dynamic effects that play a major role when studying the dynamic behaviour of FWMAVs are the sub-flap and the flap cycle-averaged effects. However, in this paper, we are only interested in modelling the flap cycle-averaged (time-averaged) effects of the DelFly Nimble. Based on this approach, grey-box models were estimated and validated for airspeeds near hover condition 0 m/s, up to 1.0 m/s forward flight. Despite the complexity of the system, we were able to obtain low-order local models that are both efficient and accurate (R2 values up to 0.92) to predict the flight dynamic behaviour of the DelFly Nimble and can therefore be used for stability analysis, simulation and control design.},

	abstract  = {Both quadcopter Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and Flapping Wing MAVs (FWMAVs) are constrained in Size, Weight and Processing power (SWaP) in order to achieve flight tasks that include attitude and velocity stabilisation, as well as obstacle avoidance. <br/>Conventional sensory and control approaches, such as those relying on inertial, visual and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, can fulfil these tasks using sensor fusion. However such approaches do not score well in terms of SWaP criteria. <br/>Very simple proportional feedback control laws using single optical flow vectors from very basic high frame-rate low-resolution cameras provide a promising path to achieve aforementioned tasks. <br/>This thesis shows that in theory these control laws are well suited for stabilising a FWMAV, and could be used for a high-drag adapted quadcopter MAV within bounds. Simulations confirm these findings and illustrate robustness to noise and additional emergent behaviour such as sideways wall avoidance and trajectory following, however simulations also show that disparity between walls can lead to unintended rotational behaviour during vertical translation. <br/>The system is tested in experiment on a quadcopter-like setup with onboard processing, using only ADNS 9800 computer mouse optical flow sensors for flight control. Results show that the system behaves similarly to simulation, however the sensory configuration used is highly dependent on texture in environment and light conditions. <br/>For future work it is recommended to investigate optical flow sensors in more detail to obtain reliable output on a vibrating platform (such as a FWMAV) in a broader range of texture and light conditions. Preliminary results from theory, simulation and experiment indicate that the addition of derivative feedback could strongly enhance performance on a quadcopter MAV and remove the requirement for high drag.},

Linearised models were used to analyse the effect on the dynamic properties of the ornithopter. Results show higher steady-state velocity and increased pitch damping for increased tail surface area and aspect ratio. The maximum span width of the tail surface is also found to play an important role in determining dynamic behaviour, in particular when the distance between the tail surface and the flapping wings is large. Steady-state conditions can be predicted accurately using linear functions of tail geometry for this ornithopter. Predicting dynamic behaviour is more complicated and requires further study.

In this study a computationally light and efficient way to enhance autonomous on-board exploration capabilities for the DelFly Explorer, a 20-gram flapping wing Micro Aerial Vehicle (FWMAV), is presented. Both theory and new insights were combined to design an exploration algorithm for the on-board stereo-vision system. The algorithm primarily consists of a disparity map based decision tree, different exploration phases and computationally light odometry. Computer simulations proved the effectiveness of the algorithm to enable autonomous exploration capabilities for the FWMAV system. Initial flight tests also show that the proposed algorithm increases its exploration capabilities and form a foundation for future research.},

	abstract  = {In the field of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) research the use of flapping wings attracts a lot of interest. The potential of flapping wings lies in their efficiency at small scales and their large flight envelope with a single configuration. They have the possibility of performing both energy efficient long distance flights as well as hovering flights. Most studies on Flapping Wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have focused on the design of the airframe and making them able to fly. Currently, the state-of-the-art permits investigation of the necessary autonomous flight capabilities of FWMAVs. Most previous studies have made important preliminary steps by using external cameras or an onboard camera with the FWMAV flying in a modified environment. However, since autonomy is most useful for flight in unknown areas, it will be necessary to use an onboard camera while flying in unmodified environments. Research in this direction has been performed on the DelFly. In particular, the well-known cue of optic flow was found to be rather unreliable for the determination of 3D distances, and it was complemented by a novel visual appearance cue. Since the combination of these cues may still not be sufficient for robust and long-term obstacle avoidance, this study focuses on a different well-known method to extract 3D information on the environment: stereo vision. The potential advantage of stereo vision over optic flow is that it can provide instantaneous distance estimates, implying a reduced dependence on the complex camera movements during flapping flight. The goal is to employ stereo vision in a computationally efficient way in order to achieve obstacle avoidance. The focus of this study is on using heading control for this task. Four main contributions are made: The first contribution comprises an extensive study on literature in the field of computational stereo vision. This research has been done for decades and a lot of methods were developed. These mainly focus on optimizing the quality of the results, while disregarding computational complexity. In this study the focus was on finding one or more time efficient methods that give sufficient quality to perform robust obstacle avoidance. It was concluded that Semi-Global Matching is a good candidate. The second contribution is that for the first time it has been investigated what the requirements are for a stereo vision system to do successful stereo vision-based obstacle avoidance on FWMAVs. In order to achieve accurate stereo vision results, both hardware and software aspects are found to be of importance. FWMAVs can carry only a small amount of payload and therefore there is a large restriction on sensor weight. The third contribution is the development of a systematical way to use the 3D information extracted by the stereo vision algorithm in order to find a guaranteed collision-free flight path. The focus was on dealing with the limited maneuverability of the MAV and the limited view angle of the camera. The fourth contribution is in giving an indication on the usefulness of stereo vision based on multiple experiments. These focus on determining the accuracy of the obstacle detection method as well as on validating the functionality of the obstacle avoidance strategy. The designed system proved to be successful for the task of obstacle avoidance with FWMAVs. The DelFly II successfully avoided the walls in an indoor office space of 7.3×8.2m for more than 72 seconds. This is a considerable improvement over previous monocular solutions. Since even reasonable obstacle detection could be performed for low-textured white walls, the experiments clearly show the potential of stereo vision for obstacle avoidance of FWMAVs. In combination with existing methods for speed and height control the proposed system has the potential of making fully autonomous (flapping wing) MAVs possible.},

	abstract  = {The Delfly is subject of great interest from the aerodynamics department at the TU Delft. Current wind tunnel measurements are performed with a dual high speed camera setup that detect particles injected in the wind stream. The difference between two subsequent images provides information on the flow field around the wings of the Delfly. These measurements are always performed with the Delfly fixed on a support. Although this method produces a lot of useful data, the restrictions that the support introduces makes it not a true representation of the free flight conditions. This thesis goal therefore, was to design, build and test a system that would enable the Delfly to fly freely in the wind tunnel. This would allow the same measurements to be performed without a support, providing insight in the influence of the support on the aerodynamic properties of the Delfly. A low-cost, high performance tracking system using two Wiimotes was developed, providing 3D position information with an accuracy of 0.8 mm and a tracking rate up to 80 Hz. A custom auto pilot module was designed, containing a 3-axis gyro and an infrared camera. A small Bluetooth module provided two way communication between the Delfly and the ground station, allowing the position information to be sent up to the Delfly and can log the information from the on-board sensors. Using the tracking system and a LED in the middle of the wind tunnel to provide the camera with a heading reference, a PI controller was implemented on-board. The controller could successfully keep the Delfly within ±1.7 cm in forward and vertical direction, and within ±3.5 cm in lateral direction of the reference point. It is the first time in the world that a flapping wing micro aerial vehicle was flown autonomously in the wind tunnel. The achieved precision is sufficient for the aerodynamic measurements to be performed, which could shed more light on the way the wind tunnel support influences the properties of the Delfly. Furthermore, for the first time, good quality data has been gathered on the dynamic behavior of the Delfly. This can serve as a starting point for future projects, such as the design of more advanced controllers that cope with the observed non-linearities or provide a reference for future research on the dynamics of the Delfly},

Conventional means of aerodynamic force generation are found lacking at this point and the apping-wing approach becomes an appealing or even necessary solution. In contrast to the conventional (fixed and rotary wing) force generation mechanisms, apping wing systems take benefit from the unsteady ow effects that are associated to the vortices separating from the wing leading and trailing edges, which create low pressure regions around the wings that lead to the generation of higher lift and thrust.},

	abstract  = {Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). MAVs are small (micro sized) aircraft and find their application in a multitude of commercial, industrial and military purposes. To perform their missions MAVs should be small sized, have good manoeuvrability, be well controllable and have a broad flight envelope. When flying in small confinements, the ability to fly at low airspeed and to have good manoeuvrability is critical. One type of MAVs, the flapping-wing MAV, particularly has attractive characteristics for flight in confined spaces. DelFly is a biplane flapping-wing MAV designed and built at Delft University of Technology. DelFly is able to hover and has an onboard camera for observation and vision-based control. For the DelFly project a top-down approach is followed, where from the study of a relative large model experience and theoretical insights can be gained, that can assist to create smaller, functional versions of the DelFly. The ultimate aim of the DelFly project is to improve the design to a very small full autonomous aircraft. For the current experimental investigation, force and flow field measurements were performed on a hovering DelFly II, since this model has a broad flight envelope and proven flight performance. The flow field is studied using particle image velocimetry. Due to the flexible wings there is a strong fluid structure interaction, therefore also the in-flight wing deformation is determined. The aerodynamic mechanism generating forces on the DelFly are related to those found in insect flight. Since leading edge vortices (LEVs) in insect flight are identified as the most important unsteady aerodynamic mechanism enhancing lift generation for insects, the development of these for the DelFly are very interesting. The vortex development is studied for various wings, at various flapping frequencies and at various spanwise positions. For the DelFly wing a conical LEV is developed, starting at out-board spanwise positions, approximately halfway during the translation. This LEV grows larger and is shed along the chord and at this time a new LEV starts to grow at the leading edge. This second LEV is dissipated at the end of the out-stroke during wing rotation, but at the end of the in-stroke this LEV moves above the wings and interacts with the counter-rotating LEV from the mirror wing. Inside the vortex tube a spanwise velocity component out-board is present. The shedding of the initial vortex and start of a second LEV is not completely consistent with LEV development for insect flight (which typically operate at a lower Reynolds number).},

The test subject of this study is DelFly II because of its stable and broad flight envelope. The aim of this study is to improve flight performance of the DelFly II. Hereto, in this thesis report, a wing geometry study is performed in order to improve the aerodynamic performance of the wing and the driving mechanism is improved in order to increase the efficiency of energy transfer from the battery to the movement of the leading edges. The current study resulted in a increase of thrust-to-power ratio of 5% due to the wing design and 20% due to the new crank-shaft mechanism},
